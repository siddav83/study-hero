Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

Used le wagon's template to create my app -  pundit is included. The app as only been initialized and currently no MVC patternd (models, controllers and views) have been added yet.

Still deciding what gem and packages to use.
